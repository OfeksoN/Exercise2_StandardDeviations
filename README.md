📊 Statistical Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on fundamental statistical concepts and operations, including:

Mean (Average): Calculating the central tendency of a dataset.
Standard Deviation: Measuring the spread or variability of data.
Sample Space: Representing all possible outcomes of an experiment.
File Handling: Reading data from CSV and other file formats for analysis.

The goal is to provide a simple yet powerful toolkit for performing basic statistical computations and probability-related tasks in Python.

✨ Features

Read data from CSV files and process columns.
Compute mean, variance, and standard deviation for datasets.
Generate and manipulate sample spaces for probability experiments.
Apply mathematical operations on selected columns.
Output results to new files or display summaries.
